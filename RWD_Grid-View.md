# Responsive Web Design: Grid-View:hibiscus:

Forget about Bootstrap, if I want to dsign a responsive website, what technique should I use:question: The answer would be grid-view.

"Grid-View" means that the page is divided into columns, usually 12 colums with a total width of 100%, and will shrink and expand as I resize the browser window. Well I think this is the essence of the front-end framework Boostrap.

In CSS3, I can use the **@media rule** to cooperate with the girids I set.
CSS3 media queries are supported in :eyes:( [the image is from here] (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) ):

I found a good example at W3C school showing how to use grid-view & media queries to design a responsive web page:eyes:: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp

After I learned this example, I developed a responsive personal web page based on grid-view technique: 

Even though later on I might probably use Boostrap, I don't want to forgrt this basic grid-view knowledge. SO I kept the projrct here, and I can review my code at any time.
