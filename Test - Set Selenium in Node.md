# Test - Set Selenium in Node

1. To start with, set up a npm project.
2. Install framework **selenium-webdriver**. <br>Notice: run this command inside my npm project folder!! :no_mouth:
```
npm install selenium-webdriver
```

3. Download browser drivers from [selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) pages (see the table in the first section). I put deivers in D:\workspace\browserdrivers.<br>

4. Set the path of the drivers. See my another tech-blog: [Test - How to set PATH variable on Windows10?](https://github.com/Yiqiuuuuuu/tech-blog/blob/master/Test%20-%20Set%20PATH%20variable.md)<br>

5. Try to test to make sure everything is working.
