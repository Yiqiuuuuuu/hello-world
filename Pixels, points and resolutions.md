# Pixels, points and resolutions

### - Pixel (a picture element: a single dot of colour on a screen)
A pixel is a single group of coloured dots (normally red, green and blue) on a screen. By turning them on and off at different intensities, any number of colours and brightness can be created.

The colour black is created when all the dots are off, and white is created when red, green and blue are all on at the same time.

In short, they are the **physical lights** on a screen that allow you to see what's being displayed where each one is so small you can't individually identify them without looking very closely.

## - Screen sizes (in inches)
这个应该比较好理解吧~~~ 就是手机屏幕的实际尺寸，就是the length of the screen **diagonally(“对角的”)** or from one corner to the other.
