Folder structure of a generic webapp:
```
  |- app/
      |- css/
      |- fonts/
      |- images/ 
      |- index.html
      |- js/ 
      |- scss/
  |- dist/
  |- gulpfile.js
  |- node_modules/
  |- package.json
```
The dist (as in "distribution") folder is used to contain optimized files for the production site.
